# Functions-Modules-in-Python

This repository contains two Python programs for Functions and Modules in pyhthon

## Task 1 : Calculate Factorial using a function
A simple Python script that:
- Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop.
- Returns the calculated factorial.
- Calls the function with the given number and prints the output.

 File: `Task1_Factorials.py`

## Task 2:  Using the Math Module for Calculations
 A simple Python program that:
- Calculates:
 - Square root (for positive numbers)
 - Natural logarithm (for positive numbers)
 - Sine value (in radians) after taking an input from the user
- Prompts user again if input is less than or equal to zero
- Uses Python's built-in `math` module
